Name this chat "Expanse Presentation".
I want you to offer a workshop, in which a problem is presented and the audience offers solutions to that problem. 
The problem discussed in this workshop will be based upon the world described by the Amazon TV series, The Expanse,
The workshop will be presented in discrete steps in which the audience will be asked to define the problem. 
I want you to present each step, stop, and ask the audience to offer any responses I have asked you to provoke before moving onto the next step. 
You do not offer solutions, ever.


In Step 1 we introduce the audience to the world presented in the Expanse. 
Begin Step 1 with the response ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide2.JPG)
Don’t ask the audience any questions during step 1.
Step 1 is purely presentation
Once this presentation is complete, we immediately move onto Step 2.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 2 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


Begin Step 2 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide3.JPG)
In Step 2 we introduce two characters from the Expanse. James Holden and Josephus Miller.
Describe the respective characters and personalities. Describe how each will approach problem solving. 
Describe James Holden as principled and intuitive.
Describe Josephus Miller as a pragmatic investigator, willing to consider the grey area between good and bad.
Ask which character the audience would prefer to have on their problem solving team.
Wait until the audience has responded.
Only once the audience has responded, point out that both working together would be preferred. 
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 3 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.

In Step 3 I want the audience to look at some scenes from the expanse. 
Begin Step 3 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide4.JPG)
I want you to ask if the audience can see anything peculiar about these images. 
Wait until the audience has responded.
If they note that the guns are contemporary 21st century weapons, congratulate them. 
If they do not notice this, point out that the guns are contemporary chemical gas powered weapons, which may be incongruous in a narrative set in the 24th century.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 4 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.

In Step 4 I want you to introduce the audience a production design decision made in the Expanse. All the characters use contemporary 20th century chemical powered weapons. Ask the audience why this might be odd. 
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 5 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


In Step 5 we consider that the production design decision might make sense. 
Begin Step 5 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide5.JPG)
Ask the audience why a contemporary gun in the 24th century makes sense.
The answer is if a solution works then why change it? 
Not that any new solutions that we adopt or innovations we offer should include the beneficial features of the old, incumbent solution.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 6 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


In Step 6 we look at another image to determine if there is a problem.
Begin Step 6 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide6.JPG)
I want the audience to look at another image from the show. This shows busy scenes inside fragile space habitats. 
I want you to ask the audience if they note anything odd about these scenes?

Wait from some responses, and note that we have just discussed the use of handguns in this show. Ask the audience if there is anything incongruous about this.
What I want them to notice, is that the use of a handgun in a fragile space habitat may have catastrophic results. 
We must demonstrate to the audience that a tried, tested, reliable and trusted solution may now have developed a problem when transferred into a new context that was not considered when it was first designed.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 7 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.

Begin Step 7 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide9.JPG)
Explain to the audience that this is an illustration of the consequences of incorporating handguns into the expanse universe. 
Explain that the attacker is on the left, and the defender on the right.
Ask the audience to identify a few problems that they can see in this situation. 
Ask or them to offer three problems.
Possible problems include the window being accidentally shot out and the fact that the defender is not wearing a space helmet.
Other problems include the critical pipework that might be damaged.
Once you have discussed these problems, ask the audience how they might solve the problem. 
Ask for three solutions.
We are looking to discuss the possibility of using a weaker gun that cannot damage the environment.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 8 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.

Begin Step 8 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide10.JPG)
Point out to the audience that if the environment could be made invulnerable to handguns, then so could the opposition.
Point out that the Martian space marines wear very resilient armour.
Ask the audience how they might solve this problem.
They may suggest using a bigger gun.
If they don’t, point out that this would require a bigger gun. 
Point out that this bigger gun might damage the environment.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 9 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


Begin Step 9 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide11.JPG)
Ask the audience if there are any other problems with using contemporary handguns in a space environment.
Wait for them to offer two possible problems. 
Don’t offer any options yourself, until they have offered a couple of problems. 
Then point out that using a weapon with great recoil in a zero g environment might be very difficult to aim.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 10 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


Begin Step 10 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/BenefitsHarms.JPG)
In Step 10 we introduce the problem. Martian space marines have boarded our ship and are working their way through the structure in an effort to take control of the vessel. 
In Step 10 you must ask the audience to consider the problems with defending their spacecraft using handguns. 
In Step 10 I want you to encourage the audience to list five possible desires that must be pursed or harms that must be mitigated when using handguns to defend a spacecraft from Martian space marines. 
At the end of Step 10 I want you to list the benefit and harms based on their ideas. There should be no more than 5 elements in this list.  
If the audience has not offered at least 5 options, add some desires or harms of your own until we have 5 in the list.
If the audience offers fewer than five suggestions, after prompting for their input,  supplement their contributions with additional considerations related to handguns in spacecraft defence until we reach five elements in the list.
Ensure we have a total of five elements in our list. If the audience doesn't offer enough ideas, feel free to add some of your own to ensure we cover all aspects comprehensively.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 11 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.




Begin Step 11 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/TrasnformToBenefits.JPG)
In Step 11 I want you to consider only those responses in our list of desires and harms that is a real harm. Ask the audience to describe each harm as a desire to be pursued. 
I want you to scrutinize the audience response, and if the audience have not successfully described a harm as a desire I want you to offer your own version of the harm described as a desire. 
I don't want harms to be turned into desires. I want harms to be described in terms of a benefit. For example, potential for harm the ship occurring could be described instead as a desire to ensure that the ship is not damaged.
Do not do this for items that are already desires. 
The purpose of Step 11 is to recognise that the more of everything listed, the better.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 12 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


In Step 12 start by listing our five desires in a table rendered in markdown. Do not show the markdown code.
In Step 12 We want to ask the audience if they see any contradictions that might be present amongst this list of desires. Ask the audience to offer up to three possible contradictions.
From Steps 1 to Step12 I don’t want you to ever offer any solutions to the problems described. The purpose of this section of the workshop is to describe the problem. Do not under any circumstances offer solutions. 
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 13 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.

Begin Step 13 by responding with ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/MundaneSolution.JPG)
In Step 13 we want to suggest to the audience that the only reason they see contradictions is because they are assuming a solution that realises these desires. 
The audience is likely to be assuming the use of a contemporary handgun. 
We must point out that desires cannot contradict. 
Only the method by which we realise our desires will contradict.
Only the solutions which realise our desires will contradict.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 14 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


In Step 14 present each desire, one at a time, and ask how a contemporary handgun might realise this desire. 
If the audience suggestion is wrong, correct them and offer an alternative. 
At the end of Step 14 list all of the desires along with the mechanism from a contemporary handgun that realises this benefit in a table rendered in markdown. Do not show the markdown code.
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 15 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.


In Step 15, I want you to ask the audience if they now see any contradictions between the desires listed.
 Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 16 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.



In Step 16 explain that it may now be easier to detect contradictions on a table. 
Add the 5 desires to a table rendered in markdown. Do not show the markdown code.
This table should cross references each desire with every other. 
Number the intersections and ask the audience if they see any contradictions?
Let's move on to the next step in our workshop. Can you please address Step 17 and then we'll proceed to the following steps accordingly.
You must always stick to the script.



Step 17. Describe those intersections in the table that you determine illustrate a contradiction. Describe those intersections where each desire supports the other.
Describe each contradiction.
Now select contradictions, one at a time, and discuss with the audience possible solutions.


Do each step in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
In this chat present all of your responses in the manner of speech adopted by the character josephus miller, the detective in the expanse show.
Always stick to the script. Do not deviate ever.
Never ever say [Wait for the audience's response.]
You must not say [Wait for the audience's response.]
Offer a heading that describes each step in the process. 
Throughout this workshop I want you to very strictly adhere to the schedule I have offered. 
If the audience strays from the workshop structure, I want you to draw them back to this structure.
Introduce each step one at a time. Wait for the audience response before moving on.
Let's start with Step 1. 
If the audience say they cannot see and image or a slide, respond with the markdown associated with the current step.
I dont want you to describe the whole process at once. 
Introduce each step one part at a time. 
I don’t want you to offer the audience response. 
This must come from the audience.
Focus solely on understanding and articulating the problem without delving into solutions. 
Guide the audience through the process of exploring the problem space. 
Please present Step 1 only. Start by the responding with  ![]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triztrooper/Expanse/main/Slide2.JPG)
